## Setup/Installation Requirements 

* _In order to utilize this page, you will need to clone a copy of this repository to your workspace using the "$ git clone {url}" in your coding terminal._ 
* _Once cloned you will need software to edit and further contribute to the code. You can download the free code editor, VS Code, at https://code.visualstudio.com/_.
* _Once installed, open the folder of the cloned repository, with will contain the HTML index, bootstrap.css and jQuery.js files, along with separate style and script pages for more personal edits._
* _You can now open each of the individual files and edit them as you see git on VS Code._
* _As you add, edit, and change your code, the command "$ git status" will inform you what has been recently altered in the git._
* _Once any changes are made, utilize the command "$ git add ." to add the necessary files to be committed_
* _To commit any changes, use the command "$ git commit -m "description of what was altered for ease of reference."_
* _For example, the command "$ git commit -m "create initial html and style sheet pages," would be a short and concise example of a good initial commit to save your work.
* _The command "$ git log" will show the history of the commits that have been made. If the list is long, you may need to type the letter "Q" on your keyboard to return to your code terminal._
* If you'd like, you can sign up for own Github account, so you can store any works of your own to share and/or publish, which can be done for free at https://github.com/_.  
* _Once you have your Github account, you can create your own repositories to share with others and publish as you see fit._
* _Create a way to save your changes to your own personal Github account by adding a remote to your page via the command "$ git remote add {nickname for your remote} {url of your Github repository}."_
* _For example, the command "$ git remote add ra https://github.com/rjashby/interior-decorator," would add a new remote called "ra" located at "https://github.com/rjashby/interior-decorator".
* _To "push" and save the changes to your Github repository, use the command "$git push {nickname for your remote} {url of your Github repository}."_ 
*_"Pushing" your commits saves them to the cloud server on Github, and allows you (or someone else) to clone down your saved repository in the same manner provided above._
